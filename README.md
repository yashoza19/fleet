# fleet

> **Status:** 🚧 Early development. Architecture agreed; implementation in progress.

OpenShift cluster fleet management for Red Hat OpenShift Partner Labs. Hub-and-spoke provisioning, post-provisioning configuration, and day-2 operations for OpenShift clusters delivered to third-party partners.

## What lives here

This repo is the **control plane** for our OpenShift fleet. It holds the declarative definitions (cluster specs, tier configs, pipeline definitions) and is the trigger surface for cluster lifecycle operations.

It does **not** hold: day-2 workloads, tenant application manifests, or anything that runs on the spoke clusters long-term. Those belong in sibling repos.

## Architecture at a glance

- **Git** (this repo) — source of truth for cluster definitions and pipelines
- **Tekton** (OpenShift Pipelines) — workflow engine for provision, post-provision, and deprovision
- **ArgoCD** (OpenShift GitOps) — manifest delivery to the hub + day-2 workload delivery to spokes via `ApplicationSet`
- **ACM + Hive** — fleet membership and cluster provisioning
- **cert-manager** — hub-side TLS certificate management; spokes receive only derived artifacts
- **Crossplane** — per-cluster IAM user generation (pre-installed prerequisite, not managed by this repo)

The guiding rule: *ArgoCD reconciles declarative state. Tekton runs ordered workflows. ACM/Hive controls cluster lifecycle.* Each tool does one job.

## Background

This repo supersedes the cluster-lifecycle portions of [`labargocd`](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-partner-labs/labargocd). Architecture rationale and migration plan are in [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md).

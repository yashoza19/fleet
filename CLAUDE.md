## Project Overview

OpenShift cluster fleet management control plane for Red Hat OpenShift Partner Labs. Hub-and-spoke architecture using Tekton (workflows), ArgoCD (manifest delivery), and ACM/Hive (cluster lifecycle). This repo holds declarative cluster definitions, Tekton pipelines, and hub config — not spoke workloads.

## Repo Layout

```
bootstrap/          — Hub bootstrap (ArgoCD, Tekton install, ACM config)
tekton/             — Pipeline, Task, EventListener, Trigger definitions
clusters/           — One directory per cluster (spec, tier label, overrides)
hub-config/         — cert-manager, baseline hub operators
cluster-templates/  — Kustomize bases for cluster specs (by tier)
workloads/          — Tier-specific day-2 overlays (base / virt / ai)
docs/               — Architecture, runbooks, diagrams
```

## Development Workflow

### Planning is mandatory

Every task — feature, bugfix, refactor — MUST begin with a written plan. Use `EnterPlanMode` or equivalent before writing any code. The plan must be reviewed and agreed upon before implementation begins.

### Required workflow: Plan -> Test -> Code -> Commit

Follow this cycle strictly, in order:

1. **Plan** — Write a clear plan for the change. Identify affected files, dependencies, and risks.
2. **Test** — Write failing tests first (TDD). Tests define the acceptance criteria.
3. **Code** — Write the minimum code to make tests pass.
4. **Commit** — Small, incremental commit with a conventional commit message.

Repeat this cycle for each logical unit of work. Never skip steps or reorder them.

### Testing and Validation

**What gets tested and how:**

| Artifact | Tool | When |
|----------|------|------|
| All YAML | `yamllint` | Every commit (tox, pre-commit) |
| Tekton Task/Pipeline YAML | `tekton-lint` | Every commit (tox) |
| Kustomize overlays | `kustomize build` + `kubeconform` | Every commit (tox) |
| Python CLI tools | `pytest` with 100% coverage | Every commit (tox) |
| Pipeline integration | Manual `tkn pipeline start` on hub | Per-phase acceptance |
| End-to-end lifecycle | Provision → post-provision → deprovision on test cluster | Phase 3+ |

**Test directory layout:**

```
tests/
├── conftest.py
├── unit/           # Python CLI tool tests (all tasks)
├── validation/     # kustomize build + kubeconform checks
└── data/           # fixtures (sample cluster dirs, expected outputs)
```

**Rules:**
- `tox` orchestrates all checks — `tox` must pass before any commit
- Validation tests for Kustomize overlays come before the YAML they validate
- Python CLI tools require pytest tests before implementation (TDD)
- Integration tests are run manually against a real hub cluster, not in CI initially

### Code Quality

**Linting (all via `tox`):**
- `yamllint` — all YAML files
- `tekton-lint` — Tekton Task/Pipeline definitions
- `ansible-lint` — Ansible playbooks/roles (when Ansible is added)
- `black` + `mypy` + `pylint` + `bandit` — Python code (from Phase 1)

**Pre-commit hooks:**
- `gitleaks` — secret detection on every push

**`tox` is the single entry point** — never run linters individually in CI or commit workflows.

## Git Constraints

### Branching

- NEVER work directly on `main`
- Create a new branch for every feature, bugfix, or task
- Branch names should be descriptive: `feat/provision-pipeline`, `fix/cert-rotation-timeout`
- MUST use git worktrees for parallel work

### Commits

- Small, incremental commits — one logical change per commit
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
  - `feat:` new feature
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `docs:` documentation only
  - `test:` adding or updating tests
  - `refactor:` code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `chore:` maintenance tasks
  - `ci:` CI/CD changes
- Scope is encouraged: `feat(provision): add validate-inputs task`
- NEVER push to remote — the user will push when ready
- NEVER amend commits unless explicitly asked

### Worktrees

- Use git worktrees when working on features to isolate changes
- Each feature branch should have its own worktree
- Clean up worktrees when work is complete

## Technology Stack

### Tekton Tasks

- **All** Tekton task logic lives in Python CLI tools, packaged via `pyproject.toml` entry points
- Tekton Task YAML contains only a thin bash stub that calls the Python CLI entry point
- Python tools are built into a custom pipeline container image (single image for all tasks)
- Scripts: single-purpose, fail fast, 100% pytest coverage required
- Image tag pinned in one place (pipeline param or ConfigMap), not scattered across Task YAML

### Automation

- Use **Ansible** when possible for configuration management and imperative operations
- Ansible is preferred over raw shell scripts for multi-step configuration
- Use Ansible roles/playbooks for repeatable spoke configuration

### Kubernetes/OpenShift

- Kustomize for manifest templating (no Helm unless existing charts require it)
- YAML manifests follow OpenShift conventions
- Cluster definitions live under `clusters/<name>/`
- Tier labels on ManagedCluster: `tier=base|virt|ai`

## Architecture Principles

- ArgoCD reconciles declarative state — never use it as a workflow engine
- Tekton runs ordered workflows — provision, post-provision, deprovision
- ACM/Hive controls cluster lifecycle
- Each tool does one job
- Hub holds secrets and signing authority; spokes receive only derived artifacts
- No hub Secret data or PII committed to git or written to spokes as-is

## Reasoning

- Never use inefficient reasoning — be direct, precise, and purposeful
- Do not speculate when you can verify
- Do not generate verbose explanations when a concise answer suffices
- Prefer reading code/docs over guessing about behavior
